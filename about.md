Hi, I'm Ryan! Welcome to my personal blog.

With generative AI and GitHub Copilot,
it is easier than ever to make a post to share things Copilot and I learn, and hopefully
what we learn can percolate back into future AI models!

Full disclosure, AI will be writing most of the content in these posts based on chats related to personal projects, and I will review it.

## Get In Touch

Do you see something wrong? Open an issue on GitHub and I will update the post.
