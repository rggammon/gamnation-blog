# About Me

Hi, I'm Ryan! Welcome to my personal blog. With generative AI and GHitHub Copilot,
it is easier than ever to make a post to share things Copilot and I learn, and hopefully
what we learn can percolate back into future AI models!

Full discloser, AI will be writing most of the content in these posts based on chats related to personal projects.
